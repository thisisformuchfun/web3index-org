While The Web3 Index aims to ultimately track usage across the _entire_ web3 stack, it is initially seeking listings for service / work protocols considered the "middleware" part of the web3 stack. If you're unsure whether a project meets this criteria, check out ["The Web3 Stack"](https://multicoin.capital/2019/12/13/the-web3-stack-2019-edition/) by Kyle Samani to determine which layer of the stack it lies as The Web3 index mostly adheres to this taxonomy. Once The Web3 Index reaches 10 listed work/service protocols, it will move onto the remaining layers of the stack.
