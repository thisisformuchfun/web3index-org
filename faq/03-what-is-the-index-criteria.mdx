While The Web3 Index aims to ultimately track usage across the _entire_ Web3 stack, it is initially seeking listings for service / work protocols considered the "middleware" part of the Web3 stack. If you're unsure whether a project meets this criteria, check out ["The Web3 Stack"](https://multicoin.capital/2019/12/13/the-web3-stack-2019-edition/) by Kyle Samani to determine which layer of the stack it lies. The Web3 Index mostly adheres to the taxonomy described in this article. Once The Web3 Index reaches 10 listed service / work protocols, it will move onto the remaining layers of the stack.
