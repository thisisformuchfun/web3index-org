The Web3 Index tracks key usage metrics for protocols across the entire Web3 stack so you can stay up to date on the latest Web3 trends whether you’re a supply-side participant or investor keeping tabs on in-demand networks, a developer interested in building on top of the most promising Web3 infrastructure, or simply a crypto-enthusiast passionate about the web3 movement.

Unlike most indexes in the Web3 space that use market capitalization or ["total locked value (TLV)"](https://messari.io/article/how-to-interpret-total-value-locked-tvl-in-defi), The Web3 Index uses a [fundamental index methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentally_based_indexes). A key belief behind the fundamental index methodology is that underlying valuation figures are more accurate estimators of a network's intrinsic value, rather than the listed market value of the project. In the spirit of this methodology, you won't see any token prices on The Web3 Index.
