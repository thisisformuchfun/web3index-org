The Web3 Index tracks key usage metrics across the entire Web3 stack so you can stay up to date on the most used protocols, whether you're a crypto-enthusiast passionate about the Web3 movement, a developer interested in building on top of Web3 infrastructure, or an investor looking to stay up on the latest Web3 trends.

Unlike most indexes in the Web3 space that use market capitalization or ["total locked value (TLV)"](https://messari.io/article/how-to-interpret-total-value-locked-tvl-in-defi), The Web3 Index uses a [fundamental index methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentally_based_indexes). A key belief behind the fundamental index methodology is that underlying valuation figures are more accurate estimators of a network's intrinsic value, rather than the listed market value of the project, i.e. that one should buy and sell tokens in line with their usage and revenue figures rather than according to their current market prices. In the spirit of this methodology, you won't see any token prices on The Web3 Index.
